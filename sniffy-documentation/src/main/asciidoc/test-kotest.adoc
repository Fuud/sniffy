== Integration with Kotest

Sniffy comes with a https://kotest.io/[Kotest] `TestCaseExtension`s for quick integration with test framework.
Just add `DisableSocketsExtension` to simulate network isolation in your tests or `SniffyExtension` to assert number of executed queries and/or opened connections

```kotlin
include::../../../../sniffy-test/sniffy-kotest/src/test/kotlin/io/sniffy/test/kotest/usage/KotestUsageTests.kt[]
```
<1> - Integrate Sniffy to your test by adding appropriate extensions
<2> - `NoSocketsAllowedExtension` would fail your test if it accesses network
<3> - `DisableSocketsExtension` can be used for simulating network isolation for your code
