== Integration with Test NG

Sniffy comes with a http://testng.org/[Test NG] `listener` for quick integration with test framework.
Just add `@Listeners(SniffyTestNgListener.class)` to your TestNG test class and place appropriate expectations on your test methods like shown below.

```java
include::../../../../sniffy-test/sniffy-testng/src/test/java/io/sniffy/test/testng/usage/UsageTestNg.java[]
```
<1> - Integrate `Sniffy` to your test using `@Listeners(SniffyTestNgListener.class)`.
<2> - Now just add `@SqlExpectation` annotation to define number of queries allowed for given method.
<3> - Just add `sniffy:` in front of your JDBC connection URL in order to enable sniffer.
<4> - Do not make any changes in your code - just add the `@Rule SniffyRule` and put annotations on your test method.
