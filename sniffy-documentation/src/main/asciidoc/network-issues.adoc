Sniffy uses heuristics to add delay for TCP connections.

Say we have specified a delay of _D_ milliseconds and have the _R_ receive buffer and _S_ send buffer

- Establishing connection adds _D_ milliseconds delay
- Sending _N_ bytes where _(n - 1) * S < N < n * S_ adds _n * D_ milliseconds delay
- Receiving _N_ bytes where _(n - 1) * R < N < n * R_ adds _n * D_ milliseconds delay
- Sending anything in the same thread as reading will trigger a delay on subsequent receive and vice versa
- Calling sendUrgentData(int) method alls _D_ milliseconds delay
- Closing connection adds _D_ milliseconds delay
