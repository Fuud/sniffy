== Integration with JUnit

Sniffy comes with a http://junit.org/[JUnit] `@Rule` for quick integration with test framework.
Just add `@Rule public final QueryCounter queryCounter = new QueryCounter();` to your JUnit test class and place appropriate expectations on your test methods like shown below:

```java
package com.acme;

include::../../../../sniffy-test/sniffy-junit/src/test/java/io/sniffy/test/junit/usage/JUnitUsageTest.java[tags=JUnitUsage]
```
<1> - Integrate Sniffy to your test using @Rule annotation and a SniffyRule field.
<2> - Now just add `@SqlExpectation` annotation to define number of queries allowed for given method.
<3> - Just add `sniffy:` in front of your JDBC connection URL in order to enable sniffer.
<4> - Do not make any changes in your code - just add the `@Rule SniffyRule` and put annotations on your test method.
